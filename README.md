# NEAT-Racer
This AI project was inspired by various YT videos and blog articles about NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmented Topologies).

NEAT-Racer is about a racing game of 30 AIs who compete with eachother.
The AI with the best gene will be selected for the next generation.
This goes on until we have the best neural network for this specific task.

I made use of the pygame and neat-python modules.
